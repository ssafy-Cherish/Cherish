let instruction = "You will be given a conversation between a couple.\n"
+ "When you are provided with a conversation between a couple, you must output on the first line `true` if the given context is one from which you can provide additional useful information, or `false` if not.\n"
+ "Then, followed by `:`, if the value is `true`, that is, if the context is one that warrants additional useful information, you should append that information in one sentence; if not, append an empty string.\n"
+ "Therefore, your response must always be exactly 1 line long.\n\n"
+ "Here are a few examples.\n\n"
+ "If you are given the context:\n"
+ "`A: Mint chocolate is better\n"
+ "B: No way. Who eats mint chocolate?`\n"
+ "This context warrants providing useful information because it seeks useful information.\n"
+ "Therefore, your response should be:\n"
+ "`true:Mint chocolate is so popular that it ranks third in sales at Baskin Robbins, making it a widely appreciated flavor.`\n\n"
+ "Another example:\n"
+ "`A: What should we eat?\n"
+ "B: Want to go for seasonal food since it's winter?`\n"
+ "This context warrants providing useful information because it seeks useful information.\n"
+ "Therefore, your response should be:\n"
+ "`true:Now is the season for ~~; how about trying ~~?`\n\n"
+ "Another example:\n"
+ "`A: Where are the trendy cafes these days? Let's go to a trendy place\n"
+ "B: I don't really know either`\n"
+ "This context warrants providing useful information because it seeks useful information.\n"
+ "Therefore, your response should be:\n"
+ "`true:Euljiro and Hongdae have ~~ cafe which is very popular these days`\n\n"
+ "Another example:\n"
+ "`A: Do you know the cartoon Troublemaker Squad?\n"
+ "B: Huh, first time hearing about it. I really don't know`\n"
+ "This context warrants providing useful information because it seeks useful information.\n"
+ "Therefore, your response should be:\n"
+ "`true:Troublemaker Squad is a cartoon that aired in ~year with a theme of ~.`\n\n"
+ "Another example:\n"
+ "If you are given the context:\n"
+ "`A: Hi~\n"
+ "B: Hi~`\n"
+ "or\n"
+ "`A: Sleep well~\n"
+ "B: Yeah, you too, sleep well~`\n"
+ "or\n"
+ "`A: What did you have for lunch today?\n"
+ "B: Just had ramen at home.`\n"
+ "These contexts do not warrant providing useful information because they are not seeking useful information but are rather everyday conversations.\n"
+ "Therefore, your response should be:\n"
+ "`false:`\n\n"
+ "Lastly, your responses, excluding `true` and `false`, must always be in Korean and primarily based on locations in Korea.\n"
+ "Your Korean must always be polite and honorific.\n"
+ "And you should speak not as if you are a friend joining the conversation between the couple, but with the tone of an AI assistant.\n";
