const instruction = "You will be given a conversation between a couple.\n"
+ "First, you must print `true` on the first line if the given context is worth saving, or `false` if it is not.\n"
+ "Hence, the first line must be either `true` or `false`.\n\n"
+ "Next, on the second line, you must print `true` if the given context is something you can throw in an interesting topic about, or `false` if it is not.\n"
+ "Thus, the second line, like the first, must be strictly `true` or `false`.\n\n"
+ "Then, on the third line, if the second line is `true`,\n"
+ "i.e., if you have thought of an additional interesting topic from the given context, you must print that topic in one sentence.\n"
+ "Therefore, if the second line is `false`, there should be no third line.\n\n"
+ "Below are some examples.\n\n"
+ "If I give you:\n"
+ "`A: Hi~\n"
+ "B: Hi~`\n"
+ "or\n"
+ "`A: Sleep well~\n"
+ "B: Yeah, you too, sleep well~`\n"
+ "This context is worth saving.\n"
+ "Because the beginning and end among a couple are precious.\n"
+ "However, it is not a context from which you can throw in an interesting topic.\n"
+ "Because greetings are a repetitive task done daily.\n"
+ "Therefore, for such a context, the output you should give is:\n"
+ "`true\n"
+ "false`\n\n"
+ "Let me give you another example.\n"
+ "If I give you:\n"
+ "`A: What did you have for lunch today?\n"
+ "B: Just had ramen at home.`\n"
+ "This context is neither worth saving nor is it something from which you can throw in an interesting topic.\n"
+ "Because this context is not a moment signifying a beginning or an end like a greeting, and it's a very common topic that could be asked.\n"
+ "Therefore, for such a context, the output you should give is:\n"
+ "`false\n"
+ "false`\n\n"
+ "Let me give you another example.\n"
+ "If I give you:\n"
+ "`A: If we went on a space journey, which planet would you want to visit?\n"
+ "B: Mars might be somewhat livable, right?`\n"
+ "This context is not worth saving but is something from which you can throw in an interesting topic.\n"
+ "Because this context is not capturing a special emotion between a couple but it is not a very common topic and is something that can bring up an interesting topic.\n"
+ "Therefore, for such a context, you could give a somewhat funny and interesting output like:\n"
+ "`false\n"
+ "true\n"
+ "Elon Musk is seriously considering plans to go to Mars, how about helping him out by investing in SpaceX stocks?`\n\n"
+ "Let me give you another example.\n"
+ "If I give you:\n"
+ "`A: It's already been a year since we met.\n"
+ "B: Really, thank you for making good memories together until now.`\n"
+ "This context is worth saving but is not something from which you can throw in an interesting topic.\n"
+ "Because this context captures a special moment and emotion between a couple but is not a topic from which you can think of an interesting topic.\n"
+ "Therefore, for such a context, the output you should give is:\n"
+ "`true\n"
+ "false`\n\n"
+ "Lastly, i'll give you contexts in Korean and your answers, except for `true` and `false`, must always be in Korean.";
